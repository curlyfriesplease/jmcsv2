# Image Transparency Fixes

## Problem
PNG images with alpha channels (jonface and splash images) appeared to be in "black containers" that blocked their outer glows and transparency effects.

## Root Cause
1. **Jon Face Images**: `border-radius: 50%` was creating circular clipping masks that cut off outer glows
2. **Splash Images**: Large `border-radius: 20px` was clipping outer effects
3. **Container Interference**: Potential background/container styling interfering with alpha channel rendering

## Solution
Created modular CSS file: `src/styles/imageEnhancements.css`

### Key Changes

#### Jon Face Images
- **Removed**: `border-radius: 50%` (was clipping outer glows)
- **Added**: Enhanced image rendering properties
- **Added**: Improved filters to enhance existing outer glows
- **Added**: `overflow: visible` to button container
- **Enhanced**: Hover effects with complementary glow

#### Splash Images
- **Reduced**: `border-radius` from 20px to 8px (preserves more outer effects)
- **Added**: Enhanced transparency rendering
- **Enhanced**: Drop shadows to complement existing outer glows
- **Added**: Image rendering optimizations

### CSS Classes Added
- `.jon-face-button-enhanced`
- `.jon-face-image-enhanced`
- `.splash-background-enhanced`
- `.splash-logo-enhanced`

### Files Modified
- `src/components/MainApp.tsx` - Updated to use enhanced classes
- `src/components/SplashScreen.tsx` - Updated to use enhanced classes
- `src/styles/imageEnhancements.css` - New modular enhancement file

## Result
- PNG outer glows and transparency effects now display properly
- No more "black container" appearance
- Enhanced visual quality with improved filters
- Maintained responsive design across all screen sizes

## Benefits
- **Modular**: Separated image fixes into dedicated CSS file
- **Documented**: Clear comments explaining each fix
- **Responsive**: Maintains enhancements across all screen sizes
- **Non-breaking**: Original classes remain intact for fallback
